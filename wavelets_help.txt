To implement the described wavelet analysis on a grayscale image in Python, you can use the PyWavelets library, which provides tools for wavelet transform and related operations. Make sure to install the library if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
pip install PyWavelets
Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing the described process:

Import the necessary libraries:
python
Copy code
import pywt
import numpy as np
import cv2
Load your grayscale image:
python
Copy code
image = cv2.imread('your_image_path.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
Perform a 2D wavelet packet transform (2D-WPT) on the image. You can specify the wavelet type and level of decomposition. In your case, you mentioned a third-level decomposition:
python
Copy code
wavelet = 'your_wavelet_type'  # Choose an appropriate wavelet, e.g., 'haar', 'db2', etc.
level = 3

coeffs = pywt.wavedec2(image, wavelet, level=level)
Extract the subbands. In your case, you are interested in the energy features of the low-frequency channel and the first, second, and third high-frequency channels. You can calculate the energy of each subband:
python
Copy code
EL = np.sum(np.square(coeffs[0]))  # Energy of the low-frequency channel

# Calculate energy of the first, second, and third high-frequency channels
EH1 = np.sum(np.square(coeffs[1][0]))  # First high-frequency channel
EH2 = np.sum(np.square(coeffs[1][1]))  # Second high-frequency channel
EH3 = np.sum(np.square(coeffs[1][2]))  # Third high-frequency channel
You now have the energy values for the different subband layers as described in your text. These values can be used as parameters for image characterization as needed.
Remember to replace 'your_image_path.jpg' with the path to your grayscale image and 'your_wavelet_type' with the appropriate wavelet type for your analysis.

This code will give you the energy values for the specified subbands based on the wavelet coefficients, allowing you to use them for further analysis or image characterization as described in your text.
